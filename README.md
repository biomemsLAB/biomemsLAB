# Welcome

Welcome to the official GitHub page of the biomems lab at the University of Applied Sciences Aschaffenburg. This repository serves as a hub for sharing the algorithms, scripts, and tools developed by our lab for analyzing data from in vitro neuronal networks cultivated on microelectrode array (MEA) chips.

## Associated Repositories

In addition to the resources hosted here, the following repositories are associated with the biomems lab and maintained on other GitHub pages:

### [CellRex](https://github.com/cellrex/cellrex)

A Python-based tool for organizing and storing data from neuronal recordings in a format that is both human- and machine-readable. This ensures efficient data handling and analysis workflows. 

### [A-Stack](https://github.com/BranchBroxy/A-Stak)

Automated Spike Train Analysis Kit A-stak is a GUI for analysing electrophysiological data. It allows to use algorithms from DrCell (MatLab) and Elephant (Python) simultaneously.

### [ML Workflow for EEG Data - Ayahuasca](https://github.com/Caroline070590/Papaer--ayahuasca)

This repository contains Python scripts for applying machine learning techniques and complex network measures to an EEG dataset from ayahuasca experiments, providing insights into altered states of consciousness.

### [ML Workflow for fMRI Data - Autism](https://github.com/Caroline070590/Paper-autism)

A machine learning workflow developed to diagnose autism spectrum disorder based on functional brain networks derived from fMRI data.

### [ML Workflow for MEA Data - Bicuculline](https://github.com/ManuelCiba/spike-train-ml-bic)

Python scripts for analyzing the effects of drugs, such as bicuculline, on spike trains from neuronal networks using machine learning workflows. This repository specializes in paired sample analysis (e.g., before vs. after drug application).
